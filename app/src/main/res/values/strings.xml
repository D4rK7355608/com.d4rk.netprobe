    <string name="question_1">What is Net Probe?</string>
    <string name="summary_preference_faq_1">Net Probe is a simple Android app that allows users to scan IP addresses and websites to determine the associated server type. The app\'s main purpose is to provide users with crucial information, such as response code, server function, response time, camera status, and the number of servers identified as cameras.</string>
    <string name="question_2">How does Net Probe work?</string>
    <string name="summary_preference_faq_2">Net Probe works by first connecting to the specified IP address or website address using a socket. Once the connection is established, the app reads the response code from the server. The response code is then used to determine the type of server. The app also checks for the presence of the word "camera" in the server\'s response. If the word "camera" is found, the app increments the server count.</string>
    <string name="question_3">What are the benefits of using Net Probe?</string>
    <string name="summary_preference_faq_3">Net Probe is a free tool that scans IP addresses and websites for potential security threats, provides crucial information, and identifies cameras.</string>
    <string name="question_4">Is Net Probe safe to use?</string>
    <string name="summary_preference_faq_4">Yes, Net Probe is safe to use. The app is open-source, which means that its code is available for anyone to inspect. This helps to ensure that the app is free of malicious code.</string>
    <string name="question_5">Where can I download Net Probe?</string>
    <string name="summary_preference_faq_5">Net Probe is available for download on Google Play Store and GitHub.</string>
    <string name="question_6">How do I use Net Probe?</string>
    <string name="summary_preference_faq_6">To use Net Probe, simply open the app and enter the IP address or website address in the text field. Then, click the "Scan" button. The app will then scan the address and display the results in a list.</string>
    <string name="question_7">Does Net Probe require an internet connection to work?</string>
    <string name="summary_preference_faq_7">Yes, Net Probe requires an internet connection to work. It needs to connect to the specified IP address or website in order to perform the scanning and retrieve the necessary information.</string>
    <string name="question_8">Is Net Probe compatible with iOS devices?</string>
    <string name="summary_preference_faq_8">No, Net Probe is currently only available for Android devices. It is not compatible with iOS devices such as iPhones and iPads.</string>
    <string name="question_9">Can Net Probe detect vulnerabilities or exploits on scanned servers?</string>
    <string name="summary_preference_faq_9">No, Net Probe is primarily designed to provide information about servers, such as response codes, server functions, and camera status. It does not specifically detect vulnerabilities or exploits on scanned servers. For comprehensive server security assessments, it is recommended to use specialized vulnerability scanning tools and techniques.</string>
