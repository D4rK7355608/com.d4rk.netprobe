## The easy way to scan IP addresses and websites! 🌐

Net Probe is a simple Android app that allows users to scan an IP address or website address to
determine the associated server type. The app's main purpose is to provide users with crucial
information, such as response code, server function, response time, camera status, and the number of
servers identified as cameras.

To use Net Probe, simply enter the IP address or website address in the text field and click the "
Scan" button. The app will then scan the address and display the results in a list.

Net Probe works by first connecting to the specified IP address or website address using a socket.
Once the connection is established, the app reads the response code from the server. The response
code is then used to determine the type of server. The app also checks for the presence of the
word "camera" in the server's response. If the word "camera" is found, the app increments the server
count.

Our app is designed to be simple and easy to use, while also being fast and lightweight. Plus, it's
free and open-source software!
